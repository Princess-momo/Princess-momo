    <h2> My Intro</h2>

    <body> My name is Omorinsola Fagbodun. Morin, for short. I grew up in Avon Indiana where i attended avon high school. I am 18 years old and have 2 younger brothers who are 11 and 10. My favorite color is periwinkle (lavander with hints of blue). I enjoy reading and dancing in my free time. my favorite food is most likely beans and corn the way my grandma makes it. Culturally i am nigerian so most of my flavor palet come from there as well. I currently attend RIT studying software engineering and minoring in legal studies with plans to go to law school after this venture.
